Given a Binary Tree. Check for the Sum Tree for every node except the leaf node. Return true if it is a Sum Tree otherwise, return false.

A SumTree is a Binary Tree where the value of a node is equal to the sum of the nodes present in its left subtree and right subtree. An empty tree is also a Sum Tree as the sum of an empty tree can be considered to be 0. A leaf node is also considered a Sum Tree.
class Solution {
    boolean ans =true;
    boolean isSumTree(Node root) {
        // Your code here
        f(root);
        return ans;
        
    }
    int f(Node root)
    {
        if (root==null) return 0;
        int left = f(root.left);
        int right = f(root.right);
        if ((root.left!=null || root.right!=null) && left+right!=root.data) ans =false;
        return left+right+root.data;
        
    }
}
